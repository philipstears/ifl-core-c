# Core in C

This is purely a play-around project. I got myself a copy of Implementing Functional Languages by Simon Peyton Jones, and David Lester - and this repo exists as a place to start working through it.

The book uses Miranda but I'm planning on using C for reasons.

This repo is basically just for my amusement - I'd suggest moving along :-)
